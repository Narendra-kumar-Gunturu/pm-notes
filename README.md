Project and Product Life Cycles

A project life cycle is a collection of project phases that defines
what work will be performed in each phase
what deliverables will be produced and when
who is involved in each phase, and 
how management will control and approve work produced in each phase
A deliverable is a product or service produced or provided as part of a project

In early phases of a project life cycle
resource needs are usually lowest
the level of uncertainty (risk) is highest
project stakeholders have the greatest opportunity to influence the project
In middle phases of a project life cycle
the certainty of completing a project improves
more resources are needed
The final phase of a project life cycle focuses on
ensuring that project requirements were met
the sponsor approves completion of the project

Products also have life cycles
The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework for describing the phases of developing information systems
Systems development projects can follow 
Predictive life cycle
Iterative life cycle
Incremental life cycle
Adaptive life cycle
Hybrid life cycle

Predictive Life Cycle Models
Waterfall model: has well-defined, linear stages of systems development and support
Spiral model: shows that software is developed using an iterative or spiral approach rather than a linear approach
Prototyping model: used for developing prototypes to clarify user requirements
Rapid Application Development (RAD) model:  used to produce systems quickly without sacrificing quality
