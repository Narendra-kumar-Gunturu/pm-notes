## Project and Product Life Cycles

1. A project life cycle is a collection of project phases that defines
2. what work will be performed in each phase
3. what deliverables will be produced and when
4. who is involved in each phase, and 
5. how management will control and approve work produced in each phase
6. A deliverable is a product or service produced or provided as part of a project

## In early phases of a project life cycle
1. resource needs are usually lowest
2. the level of uncertainty (risk) is highest
3. project stakeholders have the greatest opportunity to influence the project
4. In middle phases of a project life cycle
5. the certainty of completing a project improves
6. more resources are needed
7. The final phase of a project life cycle focuses on
8. ensuring that project requirements were met
9. the sponsor approves completion of the project

## Products also have life cycles
The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework for describing the phases of developing information systems
Systems development projects can follow 
1. Predictive life cycle
2. Iterative life cycle
3. Incremental life cycle
4. Adaptive life cycle
5. Hybrid life cycle

## Predictive Life Cycle Models
* Waterfall model: has well-defined, linear stages of systems development and support
* Spiral model: shows that software is developed using an iterative or spiral approach rather than a linear approach
* Prototyping model: used for developing prototypes to clarify user requirements
* Rapid Application Development (RAD) model:  used to produce systems quickly without sacrificing quality
